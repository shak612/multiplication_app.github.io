# multiplication_app.github.io

In this multiplication app. If user answer the correct answer then score will increase by 1 and every correct answer score will increase by 1. On the other case If user answer the wrong answer then score will decrease by 1 and every wrong answer score will decrerase by 1. This is a very simple app but can be usefull for kids.

I used in this app javascript localstorage to store the score of the user and also used javascript rendom function to update the question.
